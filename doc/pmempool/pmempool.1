\f[B]pmempool\f[] \- Persistent Memory Pool Management Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] is a management tool for \f[I]Persistent
Memory\f[] pool files created by \f[B]PMDK\f[] libraries.
.PP
The main purpose of \f[B]pmempool\f[] is to provide a user with a set of
utilities for off\-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by
pmem libraries.
The pmempool is a generic command which consists of subcommands for
specific purposes.
Some of subcommands are required to work \f[I]without\f[] any impact on
processed pool, but some of them \f[I]may\f[] create a new or modify an
existing one.
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] may be useful for troubleshooting by system
administrators and for software developers who work on applications
based on \f[B]PMDK\f[].
The latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging
purposes also.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[C]\-V,\ \-\-version\f[]
.PP
Prints the version of \f[B]pmempool\f[].
.PP
\f[C]\-h,\ \-\-help\f[]
.PP
Prints synopsis and list of commands.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
Currently there is a following set of commands available:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-info\f[](1) \- Prints information and statistics in
human\-readable format about specified pool.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-check\f[](1) \- Checks pool's consistency and repairs
pool if it is not consistent.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-create\f[](1) \- Creates a pool of specified type with
additional properties specific for this type of pool.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-dump\f[](1) \- Dumps usable data from pool in hexadecimal
or binary format.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-rm\f[](1) \- Removes pool file or all pool files listed
in pool set configuration file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-convert\f[](1) \- Updates the pool to the latest
available layout version.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-sync\f[](1) \- Synchronizes replicas within a poolset.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-transform\f[](1) \- Modifies internal structure of a
poolset.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]pmempool\-feature\f[](1) \- Toggle or query a poolset features.
.PP
In order to get more information about specific \f[I]command\f[] you can
use \f[B]pmempool help .\f[]
.SH DEBUGGING
.PP
The debug logs are available only in the debug version of the tool,
which is not provided by binary packages, but can be built from sources.
The \f[B]pmempool.static\-debug\f[] binary blob can be found in the
`src/tools/pmempool/' subdirectory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_TOOL_LOG_LEVEL\f[]
.PP
The value of \f[B]PMEMPOOL_TOOL_LOG_LEVEL\f[] enables trace points in
the debug version of the tool, as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]0\f[] \- This is the default level when
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_TOOL_LOG_LEVEL\f[] is not set.
No log messages are emitted at this level.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]1\f[] \- Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in
addition to returning the \f[I]errno\f[]\-based errors as usual).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]2\f[] \- A trace of basic operations is logged.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]3\f[] \- Enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing in
the tool.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]4\f[] \- Enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
that is likely only useful to the \f[B]pmempool\f[] developers.
.PP
Unless \f[B]PMEMPOOL_TOOL_LOG_FILE\f[] is set, debugging output is
written to \f[I]stderr\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_TOOL_LOG_FILE\f[]
.PP
Specifies the name of a file where all logging information should be
written.
If the last character in the name is \[lq]\-\[rq], the \f[I]PID\f[] of
the current process will be appended to the file name when the log file
is created.
If \f[B]PMEMPOOL_TOOL_LOG_FILE\f[] is not set, output is written to
\f[I]stderr\f[].
